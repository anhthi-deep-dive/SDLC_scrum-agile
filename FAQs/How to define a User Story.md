# Real case

Given a comple design and requirements, how can we split it into User Stories that can easily complete the Sprint goals?

# Solution

There are some keys concept when defining the User Stories

- The User Stories should be split by vertical, not horizontal. Mean, the User Stories should be defined `based on the user perspective`, not the technical perspective (User Stories for FE, BE, QA)

- The User Story should be `small enough` to complete within 1-3 development days
