# Why do we get stuck in defining and delivering User Stories?

- Unclear about requirement, take a lot of time to discuss
- Unclear about design
- User Stories are not small enough
- User Stories are defined horizontally (Technical perspective) instead of vertically (User perspective)
- User Stories are changed in Sprint
