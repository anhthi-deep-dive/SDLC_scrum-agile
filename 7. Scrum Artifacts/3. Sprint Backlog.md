# Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is `composed of the Sprint Goal (why)`, `the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what)` as well as an `actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)`

The Sprint Backlog is `a plan by and for the Developers`. It is a `highly visible, real-time picture of the work`
that the `Developers plan to accomplish` during the Sprint in order to `achieve the Sprint Goal`

Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is `updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned`. It should have `enough detail` that they can `inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum`
