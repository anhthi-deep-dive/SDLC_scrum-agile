# Increment

In scrum, a Product Increment is `whatever you previously built`, `combine with anything new you just finished` in the latest sprint, `all integrated`, `tested`, and `ready to be delivered or deployed`. Then, we can say `the Product Increments are delivered`

An Increment is `a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal`. `Each Increment is additive` to `all prior Increments` and `thoroughly verified`, ensuring that `all Increments work together`. In order to provide value, `the Increment must be usable`
