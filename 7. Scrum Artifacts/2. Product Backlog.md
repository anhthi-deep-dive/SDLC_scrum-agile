# Scrum Artifact

Scrumâ€™s artifacts `represent work or value`. They are `designed to maximize transparency of key information`. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation. Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured

- For the `Product Backlog` it is the `Product Goal`
- For the `Sprint Backlog` it is the `Sprint Goal`
- For the `Increment` it is the `Definition of Done`

# Product Backlog

# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is `a set of agreements` that `lets everyone know when something is ready to begin`

# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is `all acceptance criteria`, that `a User Story must satisfy are met` and `ready to be accepted` by a PO and team. We `must meet the definition of done` to `ensure quality`
