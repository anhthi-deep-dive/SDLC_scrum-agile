# Developers

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are `committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment` in each Sprint

Accountable for

- Creating a `plan for the Sprint`, the Sprint Backlog
- Instilling quality by `adhering to a Definition of Done`
- `Adapting their plan` each day `toward the Sprint Goal`
- `Holding each other accountable` as professionals

Developers `has ability to self-organize` when losing some roles such as Lead, QA...to make sure the team can achieve the Sprint Goals
E.g: FE dev can jump to the QA works to support when they're out of effort
