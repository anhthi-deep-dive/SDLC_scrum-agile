# Scrum Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum is `a small team of people`, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team `consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers`. Within a Scrum Team, there are `no sub-teams or hierarchies`. It is a cohesive unit of professionals `focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal`

Scrum Teams `are cross-functional`, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also `self-managing`, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how

The Scrum Team is `small enough to remain nimble (nhanh nháº¹n)` and `large enough to complete significant work` within a Sprint, `typically 10 or fewer people`

The Scrum Team is `responsible for all product-related activities` from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are `structured and empowered` by the organization `to manage their own work`. The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint
