# Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to `inspect the outcome of the Sprint` and `determine future adaptations`. The Scrum Team `presents the results of their work to key stakeholders` and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed

During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders `review what was accomplished in the Sprint` and `what has changed in their environment`. Based on this information, `attendees collaborate on what to do next`. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team `should avoid limiting it` to a presentation
