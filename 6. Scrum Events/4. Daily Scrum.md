# Daily Scrum

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to `inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal` and `adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary`, `adjusting the upcoming planned work`

The Daily Scrum is `a 15-minute event` for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is `held at the same time and place every working day` of the Sprint

The Developers can `select whatever structure and techniques they want`, as long as their Daily Scrum `focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal` and `produces an actionable plan` for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management
