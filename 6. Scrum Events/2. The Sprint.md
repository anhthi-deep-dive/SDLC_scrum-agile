# The Sprint

Sprints are the `heartbeat of Scrum`, where ideas are turned into value. They are `fixed length events of one month or less` to `create consistency`. A new Sprint `starts immediately` after the `conclusion of the previous Sprint`

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including `Sprint Planning`, `Daily Scrums`, `Sprint Review`, and `Sprint Retrospective`, happen `within Sprints`

During the Sprint:

- `No changes are made` that would `endanger (gây nguy hiểm) the Sprint Goal`
- `Quality does not decrease`
- `The Product Backlog` is `refined as needed`
- `Scope may be clarified` and `renegotiated with the Product Owner` as `more is learned`

When a `Sprint’s horizon is too long` the `Sprint Goal may become invalid`, `complexity may rise`, and `risk may increase`. Shorter Sprints can be `employed to generate more learning cycles` and `limit risk of cost` and `effort to a smaller time frame`. Each Sprint may be considered a short project

A Sprint `could be cancelled` if `the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete (lỗi thời)`. `Only the Product Owner` has `the authority to cancel the Sprint`
