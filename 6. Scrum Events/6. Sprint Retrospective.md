# Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to `plan ways` to `increase quality and effectiveness`

The Scrum Team `inspects how the last Sprint went` with regards to `individuals`, `interactions`, `processes`,
`tools`, and `their Definition of Done`

The Scrum Team `discusses what went well` during the Sprint, `what problems it encountered`, and `how those problems were (or were not) solved`

The Scrum Team `identifies the most helpful changes` to `improve its effectiveness`. The `most impactful improvements are addressed` as soon as possible. They `may even be added to the Sprint Backlog` for the next Sprint
